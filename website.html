About me:
</h2>
<p>
  I reside in the almost unknown town of Raritan, NJ with my mom and cat. When I&#146; not at sports practice, choir rehearsal, or school, you can usually find me at biking at Duke Island Park, reading at any library, or just chilling with my friends by the pool.

    To <em>perform</em>. Sometimes it happens at nine pm in the shower while singing along to my favorite song, but hey, it&#146;s art.
    </p>
<p>
  I love screenwriting and constantly generate ideas for possible plays and musicals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, my friends and I film short horror flicks. No script, as our director doesn&#146;t believe in them, but the acting isn&#146;t half bad.

        Hadrosaurous
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Hadrosaurous, found in NJ in 1838, kicked off our fascination with dinosaurs. William Foulke, on his vacation in Haddonsfield, was the first to unearth an almost complete skeleton of a dinosaur after learning that workers had found gigantic bones while mining. Visitors can still climb down into the marl pit today, and experience the primordial, other worldy quiet that echoes inside the walls.
